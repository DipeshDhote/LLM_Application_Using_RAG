## Features

- **Document Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves relevant documents from a large knowledge base.
- **Text Generation**: Generates coherent responses based on the retrieved documents.
- **Interactive API**: Provides an easy-to-use API for querying the system.
- **Customization**: Allows for fine-tuning the retrieval and generation components to specific domains or datasets.
